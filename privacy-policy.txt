==================================================
4. PERMISSION USAGE EXPLAINED
==================================================

A) COOKIES PERMISSION
   PURPOSE: Read your Zoom session cookies to download recordings you have access to
   
   HOW IT WORKS:
   - When you click "Download", we read Zoom cookies from your browser
   - These cookies are sent ONLY to Zoom's servers (not third parties)
   - This allows downloading private/password-protected recordings you can view
   - Without this, only public recordings would work
   
   WHAT WE DON'T DO:
   - Store your cookies permanently
   - Send cookies to our servers (we don't have servers)
   - Use cookies for tracking
   - Access non-Zoom cookies

B) STORAGE PERMISSION
   PURPOSE: Save download history and settings locally
   
   WHAT'S STORED:
   - Recording URLs and metadata
   - Your preferences
   - Extension logs
   
   WHERE: Chrome's local storage on YOUR device only

C) DOWNLOADS PERMISSION
   PURPOSE: Save videos and transcripts to your computer
   
   HOW IT WORKS:
   - Triggered only when you click "Download"
   - Uses browser's native download manager
   - You control where files are saved
   - No automatic downloads
